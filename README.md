# üìå Project Overview
OpenSeek is an open source project initiated by the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI), aiming to unite the global open source communities to drive collaborative innovation in algorithms, data and systems to develop next-generation models that surpass DeepSeek. Drawing inspiration from large model initiatives like Bigscience and OPT, the project is dedicated to building an independent open source algorithmic innovation system. Since the open sourcing of the DeepSeek model, academia has seen numerous algorithmic improvements and breakthroughs, but these innovations often lack complete code implementations, necessary computational resources, and high-quality data support. The OpenSeek project aims to explore high-quality dataset construction mechanisms through uniting the open source community, promote open sourcing of the entire large model training pipeline, build innovative training and inference code to support various AI chips besides Nvidia, and promote independent technological innovation and application development.

**Objectives of OpenSeek:**
- **Advanced data technology**: Address the challenge of acquiring high-quality data.
- **Multiple AI devices support**: Reduce dependency on specific chips and improve model universality and adaptability.
- **Standalised LLM training baseline**: Promote independent algorithmic innovation and technology sharing through open source collaboration.

**Project:** https://github.com/orgs/FlagAI-Open/projects/1

# üöó Getting Started

## What is Baseline
The openseek-baseline is used as the baseline for PAZHOU algorithm competition and also used to evaluate the PRs in openseek. Openseek-baseline is a standarlized LLM training and evaluating pipline, it consist of a 100B dataset[], a training code[], wandb[], ckpt[] and evaluation results[]. (Â∏ÆÂøôÊîπÊàêË°®Ê†º)

## Preparing Enviroment
1. Clone this repository and enter the directory:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/FlagAI-Open/OpenSeek.git
cd OpenSeek
```
2. Install the [FlagScale](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagScale) tool (or move it to OpenSeek if you have installed it somewhere else):

- From Source:
```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagScale.git

# Install the requirements
cd FlagScale/install
./install-requirements.sh --env train
# ./install-requirements.sh --env inference

# Install the packages with customized extensions
# cd vllm
# pip install .

# pip install -e ./megatron-energon
# cp -r megatron-energon/src/megatron/energon megatron/megatron
```

- Using Docker (coming soon)

- For more details, see [FlagScale](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagScale) or [readme](docs/FlagScale_Usage.md).

## Preparing the data
Download the [OpenSeek-Pretrain-100B](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/OpenSeek-Pretrain-100B) dataset to OpenSeek.

## Running the Baseline
Make sure you have completed the environment installation and configuration as outlined in the [previous section](#preparation). Next, you can run the baseline with a simple command:
```shell
bash openseek/baseline/run_exp.sh
```
## Compare the results
The results should be like, wandb xxxx, results xxxx.

### CCI4.0-M2 v1

[CCI4.0-M2 V1](docs/README_CCI4.0_M2_V1.md) is a large-scale bilingual pre-training dataset engineered for superior data quality and diverse human-like reasoning trajector:

|| CCI4.0-M2-Base v1 | CCI4.0-M2-CoT v1 |
|--|--|--|
|Download| [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/CCI4.0-M2-Base-v1) | [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/CCI4.0-M2-CoT-v1) |
|Notes| 5.2TB Chinese webpage, 22TB English webpage, some data released in [CCI4.0-M2-Extra](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/CCI4.0-M2-Extra-v1) due to the license concern. | 45 million CoT sample covers math, code, arxiv, wiki and webpage|





In addition to the main suite, [OpenSeek-Pretrain-100B](docs/100B_pipeline.md) was randomly sampled from the CCI4.0-M2 v1 datasets. This 100B data subset is specifically used for experimental training purposes.

Your can find more details about data [here](docs/Data.md).
